  logic base
  ~~~~~~~~~~

  Provides base configuration and code to setup Canteen ``Logic`` classes, which
  allow a developer to provide a piece of cross-cutting functionality to their
  entire application.

  ``Logic`` classes are Canteen ``Component``s, meaning they provide injectable
  structures for the DI engine. ``Logic`` classes, when bound to a string name
  with ``decorators.bind``, will be accessible from ``Compound`` object methods
  at ``self.name``.

  Example:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    from canteen import decorators, Logic

    @decorators.bind('math')
    class Math(Logic):

      """ I implement some sample math logic """

      def sum(self, iterable_of_numbers):

        """ Simple sum operation """

        return sum(iterable_of_numbers)


    # ...  later, in a page or service  ...

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    from canteen import url, Page

    @url('/')
    class Home(Page):

      """ I implement a sample homepage """

      def GET(self):

        """ I serve a sum of the numbers 0 - 20. """

        self.respond("<b>answer:</b>" + self.math.sum(xrange(0, 20)))
