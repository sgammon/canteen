  page base
  ~~~~~~~~~

  ``Page``s represnt the simplest way to respond to an HTTP request in Canteen.
  They are inherently bound to HTTP, in that you specify methods directly from
  the HTTP spec to be executed when the corresponding method is requested.

  Example:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    from canteen import url, Page

    @url('/')
    class Home(Page):

      """ I'm a page, yo """

      def GET(self):

        """ Responds to HTTP GET """

        self.respond("<b>Hello, web!</b>")
