  ''' Spawn a Canteen app, suitable for dispatch
      as a WSGI application.

      :param app: Canteen application to be spawned,
      usually passed as a Python module.

      :param dev: Boolean flag indicating we should
      operate in ``dev`` mode if passed as ``True``.
      Defaults to ``False``.

      :param config: Application configuration, in
      the form of a ``canteen.util.Config`` instance
      wrapping a dictionary of application config.

      :returns: Instance of ``canteen.Runtime`` that
      can be dispatched via WSGI and wraps the target
      ``app`` object.  '''

  ''' Run a lightweight development server via the
      currently-active runtime. Suitable for use
      locally, with no required parameters at all.

      :param app: Canteen application to be spawned,
      usually passed as a Python module.

      :param root: Unused. No fucking clue what this
      is but I'd guess it's the root filepath to the
      application. I hope it's not that, though,
      because that would break App Engine.

      :param interface: Network interface that should
      be bound to for the resulting lightweight HTTP
      server. Defaults to ``127.0.0.1``.

      :param port: Integer port number that should be
      bound to for the resulting lightweight HTTP
      server. Defaults to ``8080``.

      :param dev: Boolean flag indicating whether we
      should be running in debug mode or not. Controls
      various things like log output. Defaults to
      ``True`` as this method is only meant to be an
      easy way to put up a dev server.

      :returns: Nothing useful, as this blocks to
      serve requests forever and ever. '''
